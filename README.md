# Formal letter template

A clean, beautiful template to typeset formal letters using
[Lout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lout_%28software%29). It
resembles some examples following the German DIN 5008 standard for
business letter layouts and should be easy to adopt for your own
needs.

Although the template is intended for German correspondence, an
internationalization should be straightforward.

Feel free to deploy it as starting point for your own letters.

If you want other than the Lout standart fonts, please have a look on
[addfonts](https://github.com/smartmic/addfonts).
